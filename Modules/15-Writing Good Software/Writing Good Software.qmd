## Make code readable

-   Use lots of white space

-   Be consistent

-   Work on your style - your future self will appreciate it!

## Documentation

-   Tell us what and why, not how

-   Adding comments on how to do something is common when learning to code, but knowing how to do something isn't as important later on as *why* you did it and *what* your code is trying to accomplish.

## Keep your code modular

-   General best practice is to:

    -   Separate your functions from your analysis scripts

    -   If you find yourself coding the same thing (or nearly the same thing) more than once, consider writing a function

    -   Break things up into logical pieces and sub-tasks

    -   Put different sub-tasks in different files, depending on how long each sub-task is and how related it is to other sub-tasks

## Know that your code is doing the right thing

-   Test your code

-   Write code to test your code
